5. SQL Query
    1. 기본문법
    ```sql
    SELECT
        select_list
    FROM
        schema_name.table_name;
    ```

    2.  고객테이블의 조회
    ```sql
    SELECT
        first_name,
        last_name
    FROM
        sales.customers;
    ```
 
    3. 이메일 주소의 추가
    ```sql
    SELECT
        first_name,
        last_name,
        email
    FROM
        sales.customers;
    ```

    4. 와일드 카드 문자(*) 의 사용
    ```sql
    SSELECT
        *
    FROM
        sales.customers;

    ```

    5. 조건의 검색
    ```sql
    SELECT
        *
    FROM
        sales.customers
    WHERE
        state = 'CA';
    ```

    6. ORDER BY
    ```sql
    SELECT
        *
    FROM
        sales.customers
    WHERE
        state = 'CA'
    ORDER BY
        first_name;
    ```

    7. GROUP BY
    ```sql
    SELECT
        city,
        COUNT (*)
    FROM
        sales.customers
    WHERE
        state = 'CA'
    GROUP BY
        city
    ORDER BY
        city;
    ```

    8. HAVING
    ```sql
    SELECT
        city,
        COUNT (*)
    FROM
        sales.customers
    WHERE
        state = 'CA'
    GROUP BY
        city
    HAVING
        COUNT (*) > 10
    ORDER BY
        city;
    ```

    9. Insert 를 위한 테이블 생성

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE sales.promotions (
        promotion_id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY (1, 1),
        promotion_name VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL,
        discount NUMERIC (3, 2) DEFAULT 0,
        start_date DATE NOT NULL,
        expired_date DATE NOT NULL
    ); 
    ```

    10. Insert 문법
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO table_name (column_list)
    VALUES (value_list);
    ```

    11. 한건 입력
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO sales.promotions (
        promotion_name,
        discount,
        start_date,
        expired_date
    )
    VALUES
    (
        '2018 Summer Promotion',
        0.15,
        '20180601',
        '20180901'
    );
    ```

    12. 결과의 조회
    ```sql
    SELECT
        *
    FROM
        sales.promotions;
    ```

    13. Update
    ```sql
    UPDATE table_name
    SET c1 = v1, c2 = v2, ... cn = vn
    [WHERE condition]
    ```

    14. 수정할 테이블의 생성
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE sales.taxes (
        tax_id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY (1, 1),
        state VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
        state_tax_rate DEC (3, 2),
        avg_local_tax_rate DEC (3, 2),
        combined_rate AS state_tax_rate + avg_local_tax_rate,
        max_local_tax_rate DEC (3, 2),
        updated_at datetime
    );
    ```

    15. Insert Into를 사용한 데이터 채워 놓기
